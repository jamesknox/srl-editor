### SrlProject
-Cannot create new project in existing directory (should we?)
-SrlProject doesn't adapt to user changes in directory structure (on load or polling?)
### WordList
-Validate input to wordlists, allow literal commas?
### Rule
-Skipwords doesn't work properly... eg head(X) :- skipwords(2) strmatches(@ab) strmatches(@bc) doesnt match "a a b".
    Solution 1: Backtracking, computationally complex.
    Solution 2: Proper NFSM -> DFSM converstion, heavy memory cost.
-Handling variables correctly, eg if the same variable is defined twice in the same rule is this a syntax error, or does it only match if the same string is found?
-Overlapping matches!
-Nesting matches
-Wordlists can't match multi-word
-Literals and Wordlist, case insensitivity
-Multi-token literals, auto-split
- Check :- "start" words(1,) "end"
### Corpus
- Custom seperator tokenizer!
- Sentence splitting
### GUI
- Ruleset panel disabled on no rule selected
- Rule number change
- Make "word list sets" clear
### Other
- Check encoding on loading
- OutOfMemory Exception
